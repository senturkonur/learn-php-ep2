summary: |
    This is episode 2 of our Epic PHP series. Find episode 1
    [here](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/php-ep1).

    In this episode, we're learning all about forms, form submissions, how
    this translates the the HTTP Request/Response world, and saving files
    to the disk. This is a *huge* step forward, and all in under 30 minutes!
    You'll learn:
    
    * How to access submitted form data
    * What the HTTP method is for a request (and how to read it)
    * How to save files
    * How to redirect a user
    * What request and response "headers" are
    * Better code organization with functions.

    This will get you ready for episode 3... which is all about databases!
